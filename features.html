          <h3>End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) in Chats & Groups</h3>
          <p>Lupyd mainly focusing on security using Encryption in conversations</p>
         <p> End-to-End Encryption is essential in today’s online communication.<br>
It ensures that messages are:<br>

private<br>

secure<br>

protected from cyber threats<br>

impossible to read without authorization<br>

Whether you’re a developer or a regular user, understanding E2EE helps you choose safer apps and build trust in digital conversations in Lupyd</p>


          <h4>Lupyd uses Lib Singal - Protocal for chats Encryption </h4>
          <p>libsignal is the official open-source cryptographic library created by Signal.<br>
It contains all the low-level code needed to implement the Signal Protocol inside any messaging app.<br>
You can think of libsignal as a toolkit that developers use to add end-to-end encryption (E2EE) without writing complex cryptography from scratch.</p>
<p>libsignal uses prekeys for asynchronous messages
You can send messages even when the other user is offline <br>
The server stores temporary prekeys<br>
The sender uses them to secretly set up encryption<br>
This is how apps like lupyd and Signal allow smooth messaging without both users being online together.</p>
          <h4>For Group-chat Encryption uses Message Layer System (MLS) - Protocal</h4>
          <p>MLS (Messaging Layer Security) is a modern end-to-end encryption protocol designed especially for large, fast, and secure group chats.<br>
It is created by the (Lupyd-web-vite) and is becoming the future standard for secure messaging — especially for apps that need massive groups, multi-device, and enterprise-level security.</p>
<h5>Why Lupyd uses Group-chat Encyption </h5>
<p>MLS solves the limitations of older protocols like Signal Protocol by using a tree-based key management system,
     making it ideal for modern messaging apps Business meetups & collaboration platform. </p>
